        <i>
            Most people think of artificial intelligence (AI) as advanced gaming characters or Hollywood AIs like the voice of Siri in
            the iPhone. Whatever people think of AI, there is no doubt that it is becoming more and more prevalent in our
            lives. Here are five reasons why you should be excited about the future of AI.
            <br>
            <br> 1. Machine learning is getting smarter
            <br>
            <br> The term “machine learning” refers to the ability of computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
            This is different from traditional programming, where programmers write code to tell the computer what to do.
            With machine learning, the computer writes its own code based on the data it is given.
            <br>
            <br> This is a powerful tool because it means that computers can learn to do things that we don’t even know how to
            do ourselves. For example, Google’s AlphaGo artificial intelligence program recently beat the world’s best Go
            player. Go is a game that is far more complex than chess, and it was thought that it would be many years before
            an AI could beat a human at Go. But AlphaGo did it in just a few years.
            <br>
            <br> 2. AI is being used in many different fields
            <br>
            <br> AI is not just for gaming or Hollywood anymore. It is being used in many different fields, such as medicine,
            finance, and even law.
            <br>
            <br> In medicine, AI is being used to diagnose diseases and to develop new treatments. For example, IBM’s Watson
            computer system is being used to help doctors treat cancer.
            <br>
            <br> In finance, AI is being used to identify fraudulent transactions and to make investment decisions. For example,
            Goldman Sachs is using AI to trade stocks and bonds.
            <br>
            <br> In law, AI is being used to help lawyers research cases and to predict the outcomes of legal disputes. For example,
            the law firm Baker & Hostetler is using IBM’s Watson to assist in bankruptcy cases.
            <br>
            <br> 3. AI is becoming more efficient and effective
            <br>
            <br> As AI gets more advanced, it is becoming more efficient and effective. This is because AI can process large
            amounts of data very quickly. For example, Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence system can read and comprehend
            a whole sentence in just a fraction of a second.
            <br>
            <br> 4. AI is becoming more accessible
            <br>
            <br> AI is no longer just for big companies with deep pockets. There are now many AI tools and services that are
            available to everyone. For example, Amazon’s Alexa is a voice-activated assistant that can be used to control
            smart home devices, such as lights and thermostats. Alexa is available to anyone with an Amazon account.
            <br>
            <br> 5. AI is going to make our lives better
            <br>
            <br> AI is going to make our lives better in many different ways. For example, it will help us to be more productive
            and to make better decisions. AI will also help us to solve problems that are difficult for humans to solve,
            such as climate change and disease.
